== BPMS image

Docker image that provides a container for JBoss BPMS. Built upon the `btison/java` image. Uses a MySQL instance running in its own Docker container as database.

The image uses BPMS 6.0.3.GA. The latest security patch is applied to EAP.

Prerequisites:

* EAP 6.1.1 distribution (jboss-eap-6.1.1.zip) in `resources` directory.  

* BPMS distribution (jboss-bpms-6.0.2.GA-redhat-5-deployable-eap6.x.zip) in `resources` directory.

* BRMS/BPM Suite security patch for EAP 6.1.1 (EAP6.1.1-Patch.zip) in `resources` directory.

To build:

----
# cd bpms/bpms
# docker build -t btison/bpms .
----

To run:

First start the MySQL container:

----
# docker run -d --name=mysql-bpms btison/mysql-bpms
----

Run the BPMS container and link to the MySQL container:

----
# docker run -d --name=bpms --link=mysql-bpms:mysql btison/bpms 
----

To get a prompt into the container:

----
# BPMS_PID=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .State.Pid }}' bpms)
# nsenter -m -u -n -i -p -t $BPMS_PID
----

Both containers can also be started using fig (http://www.fig.sh):

----
# cd bpms
# fig up -d
----
